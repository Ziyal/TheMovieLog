# The Movie Log

As someone who likes to keep track of all the movies I watch, I created The Movie Log to easily create different lists to keep track of films I watch and all of my favorites. It utilizes The Movie Database API to search for and display information about various titles. Users can complete their profile, complete with profile picture, and can browse other users profiles and lists.

With this project I was able get more comfortable in several areas, such as working with API's and dynamically displaying that information with jQuery. One of the biggest challenges was learning how to upload photos and store them in my server. There are a few minor bugs which I plan on fixing in the future, like some CSS issues when the page expands after searching for a movie.
